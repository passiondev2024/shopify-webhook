So I have an app 'locksmith' on my shopify. my whole store is protected by passcodes. We have a project for menstrual poverty and every student can buy at a very low price some period underwear through us. To make sure that only students can buy these, we have locked the site with locksmith. Every school gets an unique passcode. After every kid has purchased a pant, we need to know to which school every student belongs. Therefore we want that after a purchase, there is information 'fired' as a tag to the customer tags in shopify. The tag needs to be identical to the passcode of locksmith. This way we can identify them
